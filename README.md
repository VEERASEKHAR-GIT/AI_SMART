# README — SQL vs. RAG for Structured Data (Simple English)

## Overview
When you work with structured data (like databases, tables, CSV files), **SQL queries** are usually much better than **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for asking questions and getting answers.  
RAG works great for unstructured text (like documents or articles), but for structured data it has problems like wasting tokens, breaking data links, high costs, and losing accuracy.

## Problems with RAG on Structured Data

### 1. Token Wasting
- Turning tables into text takes up a lot of space.
- Even small datasets can be too big for the AI to handle at once.
- To fit, the data is split into smaller pieces (chunks), which makes it less useful.

**Example:**
- **Dataset:** 1 million rows × 10 columns = 10 million pieces of data  
- **RAG:** Splits into 1000-token chunks  
- **Result:** AI loses the big picture.

### 2. Breaking Data Links
When data is split into chunks, rows and columns lose their connections.

**Original Table**
| Name  | Age | Salary | Department  |
|-------|-----|--------|-------------|
| Alice | 25  | 50000  | Engineering |
| Bob   | 30  | 60000  | Engineering |

**After Chunking**
- Chunk 1: “Alice, 25, 50000”
- Chunk 2: “Engineering, Bob, 30”
- Chunk 3: “60000, Engineering”

Now we can’t be sure Alice works in Engineering.

### 3. Loss of Accuracy
- RAG might miss rows that are important.
- Filters, joins, and calculations might be wrong.
- Results may skip data close to the limits.

---

### 4. High Costs
Using RAG on big structured data is expensive:

**a) Embedding costs**
- Every row needs to be turned into a vector.
- Millions of rows = high cost.

**b) Storage costs**
- Need a big vector database.
- More data means more storage fees.

**c) Query costs**
- Each question may need many searches in the database.
- Searching big databases takes time and money.

**d) Processing costs**
- Retrieved chunks still go to the AI model.
- More chunks = more tokens = more cost.

## Why SQL is Better for Structured Data
1. **Keeps Data Links** — Rows and columns stay connected.
2. **Uses Database Power** — Databases are fast and optimized for this work.
3. **Fewer Tokens** — Only the query and results are sent to the AI.
4. **Accurate** — Exact filters, joins, and calculations work properly.

## When to Use Each

**Use SQL (most of the time)**
- For numbers, filters, and large datasets.
- When you need accuracy and repeatable results.

**Use RAG**
- For free-form text like documents and PDFs.
- For meaning-based searches.

**Use Both Together**
- Use SQL to get the facts.
- Use RAG or AI to explain or give extra context.

## Recommended Workflow
1. **Show Only Needed Tables/Columns** — Give AI just what it needs.
2. **Make AI Write Safe SQL** — Add rules to avoid unsafe queries.
3. **Check Queries Before Running** — Make sure they are correct and safe.
4. **Run the Query in the Database** — Let the DB do the heavy work.
5. **Explain the Results** — Use AI or RAG for summaries.
